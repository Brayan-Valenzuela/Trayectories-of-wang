# Trayectories-of-wang
- If wanna draw your trayectories using the class contained in the notebook called "Draw_Trajectories_by_Fabio_Martinez_and_Brayan_Valenzuela.ipynb", First parameter of the class is the path of the video, the second is the name of your video and the last one is the name of the folder where the frames will be saved
<h2><span style="color:#FFF; background-color:#F00; font-weight:bold; padding:4px;">Important!</span></h2><br><h2 style="margin-top:-10px;"></h2>
- this class is designed to work with videos that have less than 1000 frames, if you want to draw the trajectories in a longer video for example more than 1000 frames you must modify "sacar_fotogramas.sh" and change "fotograma-% 3d.png" por "fotograma-%4d.png" and modify the "SortDir" function so that it recognizes 4-digit indies.
